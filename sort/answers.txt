sort1 uses: BUBBLE SORT

How do you know?: The program repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements, and continues to do so until the list is fully sorted. This behavior is characteristic of bubble sort.

sort2 uses: MERGE SORT

How do you know?: The program recursively divides the list into smaller parts and merges them back together in sorted order. This is characteristic of merge sort.

sort3 uses: SELECTION SORT

How do you know?: The program selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the element at the current position, which is characteristic of selection sort.
